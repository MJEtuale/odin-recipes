      <li>4 cloves finely diced garlic.</li>

     </ul>
      <h3>

  <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <h3>Dough:</h3>
      <li>Yeast Activation: Place yeast, sugar and water in a small bowl. Mix, then set aside for 10 minutes until it becomes foamy.</li>
      <li>Place flour, cornflour and sugar in a stand mixer bowl fitted with a dough hook. Mix briefly to combine.</li>
      <li>Add yeast mixture, oil and water. Mix on low speed for 3 minutes until a smooth ball of dough forms. It should be soft and elastic, not so sticky it gets stuck all over your hands. Adjust with a touch of flour/water if required to get the dough consistency right.</li>
      <li>Cover with cling wrap and place in a warm dry place for 2 hours until it doubles in volume. (Note 3). Meanwhile, make Filling.</li>
      <li>Remove cling wrap, scatter over baking powder. Return to stand mixer and mix on low for 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Turn dough out onto work surface, sprinkle with flour. Knead lightly to form a smooth round disc.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <h3>Steaming:</h3>
      <li>Line a large bamboo steamer (or other steamer) with parchment paper punctured with holes (Note 4).</li>
      <li>Place 6 to 8 buns on paper, cover with steamer lid.</li>
      <li>Pour about 4 cm / 1 1/2 inches in a wok / pot (steamer should not touch water) and bring to rapid simmer over medium high.</li>
      <li>Place steamer in wok, then cook for 12 minutes. Check water halfway through, top up if required.</li>
      <li>Buns are ready when they spring back when touched, and the buns have formed a smooth skin.</li>
      <li>Remove steamer from wok, serve warm!</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <h3>Filling:</h3>
      <li>Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add eschalots and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil and water. Mix.</li>
      <li>While stirring, slowly pour cornflour mixture in. Mix until smooth.</li>
      <li>Stir in lamb. Cook until sauce is thickened, 1 - 1 1/2 minutes. Set aside to cool (thickens when cools).</li>
    <ol>
      <h3>Recipe Notes:</h3>
      <li>Eschalots are the small onions which are finer than ordinary onions. Even brown onions or the white part of shallots/scallions/green onions will do here.</li>
      <li>Weird but wonderful tip, especially great in winter: DRYER! Run empty dryer for 1 minute, then place bowl inside. Draught free, cosy warm, perfect dough rising environment.</li>
      <li>Paper steamer liners are sold at Asian stores but I've never purchased them. It's super simple to make (see photos in post & video): get a piece of baking paper, fold in half then quarters, keep folding until you make a thin triangle. Line up with the centre of the steamer then snip the end off. Then snip little triangles along both edges (these become the holes). Unfold and place in steamer.</li>

    <ol>
      <h3>Storage:</h3>
      <li>Cook then refrigerate or freeze.</li>
      <li>Fridge - 3 to 4 days, microwave briefly to warm through.</li>
      <li>Freeze - microwave, covered with damp paper towel, from frozen for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until piping hot. These are exceptional freezer friendly snacks - once reheated, it's just like fresh out of the bamboo steamer!</li>
